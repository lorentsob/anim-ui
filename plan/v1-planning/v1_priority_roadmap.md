# BW Animator v1.0 Priority Roadmap

_Created: 2025-09-16_
_Focus: Advanced Animation Capabilities & UX Optimization_
_Timeline: 13 weeks (Accelerated from original 14-week plan)_

## üéØ User Priority Goals

> **Primary Objective**: "Optimize UX for better experience, enable advanced animations without current limitations"

### Success Definition
- Create professional-grade animations up to 4K resolution
- Timeline-based animation with keyframe control
- Multi-effect compositions with blend modes
- Smooth 60fps preview and export capability
- No artificial creative constraints

---

## üö® Critical Issues Addressed

### Current Blockers Identified:
1. **Hard Canvas Limit**: 2048px maximum prevents 4K creation
2. **FPS Cap**: 30fps maximum limits smooth motion capability
3. **Duration Constraint**: 30s maximum prevents longer content
4. **Parameter Ranges**: Effect parameters have narrow creative ranges
5. **No Timeline System**: Only static parameters, no animation over time
6. **Single Effect Limitation**: Cannot layer or blend multiple effects

### Solution Approach:
**Front-load constraint removal and timeline implementation** in first 5 weeks to unlock creative potential immediately.
