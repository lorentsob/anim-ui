# BW Animator Planning Documentation

_Organized: 2025-09-16_

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### **`mvp-completed/`** - Completed MVP Phase Documents

Historical documentation from the successful MVP development phase.

- **`bw_animator-plan.md`** - Original project concept and plan
- **`bw_animator_mvp_spec_build_plan_next_js_15_p_5.md`** - Detailed MVP specification and build plan
- **`performance_notes.md`** - MVP performance observations and optimizations
- **`qa_matrix.md`** - Cross-browser testing matrix and results

### **`v1-planning/`** - Next Phase v1.0 Development

Active planning documents for the v1.0 advanced features phase.

#### Architecture & Decisions

- **`architecture_decisions.md`** - Core architectural decisions for timeline, quality, and composition
- **`v1_critical_questions.md`** - Analysis of current limitations and critical questions
- **`executive_summary.md`** - High-level overview of v1.0 plans and decisions

#### Development Planning

- **`v1_development_roadmap.md`** - Comprehensive 13-week development roadmap
- **`v1_priority_roadmap.md`** - User-priority driven development timeline
- **`implementation_guide.md`** - Week-by-week implementation instructions with code examples
- **`v1_acceptance_criteria.md`** - Detailed acceptance criteria and success metrics

### **Root Level** - Current Active Documents

- **`project_status.md`** - Current project status and recent updates
- **`project_tasks.md`** - Task tracking and completion status

## üéØ Quick Navigation

### **To Understand Current State**

‚Üí `project_status.md` - Latest project status
‚Üí `project_tasks.md` - What's been completed

### **To Start v1.0 Development**

‚Üí `v1-planning/executive_summary.md` - Overview of plans
‚Üí `v1-planning/architecture_decisions.md` - Technical decisions
‚Üí `v1-planning/implementation_guide.md` - Step-by-step instructions

### **For Historical Context**

‚Üí `mvp-completed/` - How we got to the current MVP state

## üìã Development Status

### **MVP Phase: ‚úÖ Complete**

- 6 effects implemented (Square Drift, ASCII Dither, Cellular Automata, Scanline Reveal, Orbiting Bars, Ripple Quantized)
- Complete export pipeline (WebM, GIF, PNG)
- Preset management and sharing system
- Full UI with notifications and history

### **v1.0 Phase: ‚úÖ Timeline System Operational**

- Architecture decisions finalized
- Implementation roadmap complete
- Priority timeline established
- Week 1 constraint removal completed
- **Timeline integration crisis resolved (September 17, 2025)**
- Full keyframe animation system now functional

### **Current Status**

1. ‚úÖ Week 1 Complete: Creative constraints removed (8K, 120fps, 300s)
2. ‚úÖ Timeline Foundation: Keyframe animation pipeline operational
3. ‚úÖ Critical Integration: Timeline-to-viewport connection restored
4. üîÑ Next: Advanced timeline features and export optimization

## üîó Key Cross-References

### **From MVP to v1.0**

The v1.0 planning builds directly on MVP success, addressing user needs for:

- Advanced animation capabilities (timeline, keyframes)
- Removal of creative constraints (canvas size, fps, duration)
- Professional composition features (multi-effects, blend modes)

### **Implementation Dependencies**

- v1.0 architecture maintains backward compatibility with MVP
- Timeline system is additive and optional
- Quality tiers replace hard constraints without breaking existing workflows

This organization separates completed work from active planning, making it easier to focus on next phase development while maintaining historical context.
