## QA Checklist

- [ ] Baseline playback: Preview & Render modes match expected FPS and scaling.
- [ ] Effect switching: Params reset, animations deterministic across reloads.
- [ ] Preset actions: Save/apply/delete, notifications visible, persisted after refresh.
- [ ] Exports:
  - [ ] WebM: Captures frames, auto-download triggers (on supported browsers).
  - [ ] GIF: Palette/dither output looks acceptable, download available.
  - [ ] PNG ZIP: Progress/ETA updates show, ZIP contents correct.
  - [ ] Heavy export warnings fire in Preview mode and respect overrides.
- [ ] Export history: Entries added, re-download works, removal revokes URLs.
- [ ] Notifications: Toast auto-dismiss timing consistent, no overlap issues.
- [ ] Accessibility scan: Tab order reasonable, focus states visible.

> Update status column and add observations per run.
