# Critical Questions & Blockers Before v1.0 Phase

_Analysis Date: 2025-09-16_
_Priority: High - Address before development starts_

## Executive Summary

Based on codebase analysis and user priorities for advanced animation capabilities, several critical limitations and questions need resolution before v1.0 development begins. Current constraints significantly limit the ability to create sophisticated animations.

---

## ðŸš¨ Critical Limitations Identified

### 1. **Hard-Coded Constraints** (Blocking Advanced Use)

#### Canvas & Timing Limits (`src/store/useEditor.ts`)
```typescript
// Current limitations:
sanitizeDimension: Math.max(32, Math.min(2048, value))  // Max 2048px
sanitizeFps: Math.max(1, Math.min(30, Math.round(value))) // Max 30fps
sanitizeDuration: Math.max(1, Math.min(30, Math.round(value))) // Max 30s
```

**Impact**: Cannot create:
- 4K animations (3840Ã—2160)
- High-framerate content (60fps for smooth motion)
- Long-form content (>30s sequences)
- Detailed artwork requiring large canvases

#### Parameter Constraints in Effects
```typescript
// Example from rippleQuantized.ts:
{ key: "rings", type: "int", min: 2, max: 32 }  // Only 32 rings max
{ key: "spacing", min: 20, max: 120 }           // Limited range
```

**Impact**: Effects have narrow creative ranges, preventing complex compositions.

### 2. **Performance Warnings** (UX Friction)

#### Export Size Warnings (`src/components/RecorderBar.tsx`)
```typescript
const warnLarge = enableWarnings && (frameComplexity > 80_000_000 || totalFrames > 600);
```

**Impact**: Warnings trigger at moderate settings (e.g., 1920Ã—1080 @ 12fps for 6s = ~600 frames), creating unnecessary friction for standard use cases.

### 3. **Missing Advanced Animation Features**

#### Timeline/Keyframe System
- **Status**: Marked as "completed" but no implementation found in codebase
- **Current**: Only static parameter values per effect
- **Needed**: Time-based parameter automation, keyframe interpolation

#### Effect Composition
- **Current**: Single effect per animation
- **Needed**: Layer multiple effects, blend modes, masking

#### Advanced Controls
- **Current**: Basic numeric inputs only
- **Needed**: Curve editors, color pickers (for grayscale mapping), preset variations

## ðŸ¤” Strategic Questions Requiring Decisions

### 1. **Performance vs. Capability Trade-offs**

**Question**: Should we maintain current performance constraints or enable professional-grade capabilities?

**Options**:
- A) Keep limits, focus on ease-of-use for casual creators
- B) Remove limits, add performance warnings/degradation modes
- C) Tiered approach: "Basic" and "Pro" modes

**Recommendation**: Option C - Implement capability tiers to serve both audiences.

### 2. **Architecture: Real-time vs. Offline Rendering**

**Question**: How do we handle complex animations that can't render in real-time?

**Current**: All rendering is real-time in browser canvas
**Challenge**: Complex animations may need offline/background rendering

**Options**:
- A) Web Workers for background rendering
- B) Server-side rendering for heavy operations
- C) Progressive quality degradation with background upgrades

### 3. **Timeline System Architecture**

**Question**: How do we implement keyframes without breaking existing effect architecture?

**Current**: Effects receive static parameters: `render(p, ctx, t, frame, params)`
**Needed**: Time-varying parameters: `render(p, ctx, t, frame, animatedParams)`

**Architecture Decision**: Implement timeline layer above effects vs. rebuild effect interface.

### 4. **Effect Composition Model**

**Question**: How do we enable effect layering/blending?

**Options**:
- A) Canvas-based composition (render to offscreen canvases, composite)
- B) Shader-based composition (WebGL blending)
- C) Mathematical composition (combine effect algorithms)

### 5. **Export Pipeline Scaling**

**Question**: How do we handle large/long exports without browser constraints?

**Current Limitations**:
- Browser memory limits for large canvases
- UI blocking during long exports
- No partial export recovery

**Solutions Needed**:
- Chunked export processing
- Background/worker-based export
- Resume capability for failed exports
