# Project Status â€“ BW Animator v1.0 Development

_Last updated: 2025-09-16 22:41 CDT_

## Overall

**MVP Complete!** Interactive editor with 6 effects, deterministic playback, preset storage, and comprehensive export flows. Currently transitioning to v1.0 development phase focusing on production readiness, advanced features, and community tools. Full MVP+ feature set delivered including recently completed roadmap items.

## Delivered

- **UI Shell**: Top bar with AE-style scrubbing controls, canvas host, parameter panel, status bar, notification tray.
- **Effects**: 6 implemented (`Square Drift`, `ASCII Dither`, `Cellular Automata`, `Scanline Reveal`, `Orbiting Bars`, `Ripple Quantized`) with shared effect contract.
- **State & Persistence**: Zustand store for globals + params, preset manager backed by localStorage.
- **Renderer**: Instance-mode p5 wrapper with deterministic frame stepping and export-ready hook (`createExportSketch`).
- **Exports**: Recorder bar supports WebM (MediaRecorder), GIF (gifenc 1-bit palette), PNG sequence (ZIP). Cancellable with progress reporting. Includes recent export history list.
- **UX Polish**: Notifications for exports & preset actions, large-job warnings, auto-download for WebM/GIF, cancellation handling, preview vs render toggle, preview canvas scaling. Toast log accessible from status bar.

## Recently Completed (Post-MVP)

- âœ… **Advanced Effects**: Orbiting Bars + Ripple Quantized effects delivered
- âœ… **Shareable URLs**: URL-based state sharing system implemented
- âœ… **MP4 Export**: ffmpeg.wasm integration with progress UI complete
- âœ… **Keyframe Support**: Parameter automation system functional
- âœ… **ZIP Optimizations**: Enhanced PNG sequence compression implemented
- âœ… **Week 1 Complete: Creative Constraints Removed**
  - Canvas size increased from 2048px â†’ 8192px (8K support)
  - Frame rate increased from 30fps â†’ 120fps
  - Duration extended from 30s â†’ 300s (5 minutes)
  - Quality tier system implemented with smart performance scaling
  - UI updated with new limits and quality feedback
  - All tests passing with comprehensive quality manager coverage

## v1.0 Development Phase

**Status**: Week 2 Foundation Complete - Timeline System Operational
**Target**: Q1 2025 production release
**Current Phase**: Timeline & Advanced Animation (Weeks 2-5)
**Next Milestone**: Timeline UI panel and visual scrubbing (Week 3)

**Focus Areas**:

1. âœ… **Foundation Hardening**: Creative constraints removed, quality tiers implemented
2. ðŸ”„ **Advanced Creation Tools**: Timeline foundation complete, UI panel next (Week 3-5)
3. **Sharing & Community**: Gallery system, preset marketplace, social integration
4. **Production Readiness**: Monitoring, documentation, deployment infrastructure

See `plan/v1-planning/v1_development_roadmap.md` for detailed implementation timeline and specifications.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Export performance**: Large frame counts can still freeze UI; cancellation helps but need preflight warnings/limits.
- **GIF quality**: Current 1-bit palette is fast but may look harsh; consider palette refinement or per-frame quantization.
- **Browser compatibility**: Safari MediaRecorder gapsâ€”need fallback messaging and QA passes.

## v1.0 Strategic Questions

- **Community Features**: Should we implement user accounts or continue with anonymous sharing? --> **Anonymous**
- **Platform Expansion**: Mobile apps or PWA-first approach for broader reach? --> **PWA**
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Serverless (Vercel/Netlify) vs. dedicated infrastructure for v1.0 scale? --> **Vercel**
